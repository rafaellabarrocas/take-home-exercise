## 1. What are you hoping to find in your next position that would make it the right next step in your career?
*I love coding and getting to know new people and new technologies but the main thing is, I would like to work in a company that has the values that I believe in: People Driven*.

## 2. What have you learned so far about LawnStarter that excited you?
*I always appreciate jobs and services without bureaucracy and that is as comfortable as possible. I found the services sold by LawnStarter*

## 3. Have you worked in a setting where developers own delivering features all the way to production? We have QA (Quality Assurance) and a Product Operations team, however, they exist to provide support to engineers. Are you comfortable in an environment which challenges quality engineers to constantly look for opportunities to automate and ensure quality software is delivered on a daily basis?
*I love that kind of environment. I already worked on a much similar environment when I worked for Dell Company and had to automate the entire https://dell.com website.*

## What is the next technology or subject you are hoping to learn about?
*Right now I’m digging into Python. It’s been almost 2 years working directly with Python. But I also would like to learn Ruby. But as I said, I love to learn new technologies. That’s never been a problem for me.*
